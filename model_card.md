## Model Details
This model was created by JÃ¼rgen Bullinger for the Udacity Capstone project for course 4 of the MLOps Certificate.
It uses a RandomForestClassifier with a maximum of 100 estimators (as in the default) and to avoid overfitting, max_depth was set to 3 and min_samples_leaf was set to 5.
These are guessed values. These values could be optimized by e.g. a grid search.
The model is stored in model/model.pkl

## Intended Use
Predict the income class of the citizens according to the response they give in the census.
